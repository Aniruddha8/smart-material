			<p class="first">The simplest definition of piezoelectric materials can be obtained by first dividing the word into piezo and electric. Piezo is from the Greek word piezein, which means ‘‘to press tightly or squeeze.’’ Combining piezein with electric, we have ‘‘squeeze electricity.’’</p>
			<p>Piezoelectricity could be referred to as the capability of some materials, particularly in the form of crystals and ceramics, to produce an electric potential as a response to an input in the form of an applied mechanical stress. This phenomenon is defined as the “direct piezoelectric effect”. The converse piezoelectric effect is, however, when the materials produce a stress and/or strain (output) when an electric field is applied as input. </p>
			<p>In 1880, Pierre and Jacques Curie published the first experimental demonstration of a connection between macroscopic piezoelectric phenomena and crystallographic structure. In this experiment, a mechanical stress was applied on a specially prepared crystals and a conclusive measurement of surface charges was performed. These specially prepared crystals were mainly composed of quartz, Rochelle salt, tourmaline, cane sugar and topaz</p>

			<p class="first">Electrostriction is a property of all electrical non-conductors, or dielectrics that causes them to change their shape under the application of an electric field. Electrostriction is a property of all dielectric materials, and is caused by the presence of randomly aligned electrical domains within the material. When an electric field is applied to the dielectric, the opposite sides of the domains become differently charged and attract each other, reducing material thickness in the direction of the applied field. The resulting strain is proportional to the square of the polarization. Reversal of the electric field does not reverse the direction of the deformation. Electrostriction can produce a strain of 0.1% at field strength of 2 million volts per meter (2 MV/m) for the material called PMN-15. The effect appears to be quadratic at low field strengths and roughly linear after that, up to maximum field strength of 4 MV/m. Therefore, devices made of such materials are normally operated around a bias voltage in order to behave nearly linearly. This will probably cause deformations to lead to a change of electric charge, but this is unconfirmed.</p>

			<h3 id="magneto">Magnetostrictive Materials</h3>
			<p class="first">Magnetostrictive materials are materials that have the material response of mechanical deformation when stimulated by a magnetic field. Shape changes are the largest in ferromagnetic materials. Internally, ferromagnetic materials have a structure that is divided into domains, each of which is a region of uniform magnetic polarization. When a magnetic field is applied, the boundaries between the domains shift and the domains rotate; both of these effects cause a change in the material's dimensions.</p>
			<p>Magnetostrictive materials are usually inorganic in chemical composition and are alloys of iron and nickel and doped with rare earths. The most effective magnetostrictive material is another alloy developed at the Naval Ordinance Laboratory, TERFENOL-D. It is an alloy of terbium, dysprosium, and iron. The full effect of magnetostriction occurs in crystalline materials. One factor preventing magnetostrictive materials from reaching commercial significance has been cost. Over the past three decades there has been a great deal of development of giant Magnetostrictive   materials, colossal Magnetostrictive materials, and organic and organometallic magnets.</p>
